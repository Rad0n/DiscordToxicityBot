Place the token in 'discord_bot_token`.



To get the discord bots's id, just right click the bot's name and copy id. Paste that here in 
`discord_bot_id`



Similarly add the admins' ids in `admin_ids`. Keep them in the square brackets separated by commas.
If there is only one admin then there is no need of commas.
